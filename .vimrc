To complete this lab, I followed the guided lab instructions. First I created my VIM configuration using the 'vim .vimrc' command, then I inserted the required configurations, and saved my file. I then used the terminal to save my file to the desktop and rename it. I am very unfamiliar with the terminal and command processes so I had several struggles throuought.
